            "note": "It is so incredibly unique and written in a way that is so thoughtful and thought provoking and unexpected. The whole book is in the form of a standardised test. The first few pages you don't really know what to do because you'll just be staring at test questions that are so incredibly abstract and confusing but then as you go on your own mind takes you on your own journey and it is insanely crazy. i first read the english translation a year ago and picked it up again last week, it feels like a new book because so much of it is self created. The author has done SUCH a good job at provoking thoughts and then letting you stew in them without and meddling. it's a book i'll never finish reading \u2013 in short \u2013 10/10 please read"
